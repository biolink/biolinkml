/*

  This document contains logical formulae specifying the semantics of
  the biolink modeling language (biolinkml). See the README.md file in
  this directory for more details.

  These rules are executable and can be used for validation, or
  inferring useful type information.

  Conventions:

   - we never use the same predicate name for an asserted (unit
   clause) predicate and inferred predicate. asserted predicates come
   only from conversion of the yaml (see tests/biolink.pro for an
   example). inferred predicates are never unit clauses, and are inferred only from the rules below.
  
   - `direct` indicates a non-transitive connection (may be inferred)

   - Predicates such as subclass_of/2 and subrelation_of/2 are inferred

% note however, that this entailment is considered outside the object-oriented set of entailments,
