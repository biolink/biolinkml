# Metamodel schema


A metamodel for defining biolink related schemas


### Classes

 * [AltDescription](AltDescription.md) - an attributed description
 * [Element](Element.md) - a named element in the model
    * [Definition](Definition.md) - base class for definitions
       * [ClassDefinition](ClassDefinition.md) - the definition of a class or interface
       * [SlotDefinition](SlotDefinition.md) - the definition of a property or a slot
    * [EnumDefinition](EnumDefinition.md) - List of values that constrain the range of a slot
    * [SchemaDefinition](SchemaDefinition.md) - a collection of subset, type, slot and class definitions
    * [SubsetDefinition](SubsetDefinition.md) - the name and description of a subset
    * [TypeDefinition](TypeDefinition.md) - A data type definition.
 * [Example](Example.md) - usage example and description
 * [Extension](Extension.md) - a tag/value pair used to add non-model information to an entry
    * [Annotation](Annotation.md) - a tag/value pair with the semantics of OWL Annotation
 * [LocalName](LocalName.md) - an attributed label
 * [PermissibleValue](PermissibleValue.md) - a permissible value, accompanied by intended text and an optional mapping to a concept URI
 * [Prefix](Prefix.md) - prefix URI tuple

### Mixins

 * [Annotatable](Annotatable.md) - mixin for classes that support annotations
 * [Extensible](Extensible.md) - mixin for classes that support extension

### Slots

 * [abstract](abstract.md) - an abstract class is a high level class or slot that is typically used to group common slots together and cannot be directly instantiated.
 * [alias](alias.md) - the name used for a slot in the context of its owning class.  If present, this is used instead of the actual slot name.
 * [aliases](aliases.md)
 * [alt_description➞source](alt_description_source.md) - the source of an attributed description
 * [alt_description➞description](alt_description_text.md) - text of an attributed description
 * [alt_descriptions](alt_descriptions.md)
 * [apply_to](apply_to.md) - Used to extend class or slot definitions. For example, if we have a core schema where a gene has two slots for identifier and symbol, and we have a specialized schema for my_organism where we wish to add a slot systematic_name, we can avoid subclassing by defining a class gene_my_organism, adding the slot to this class, and then adding an apply_to pointing to the gene class. The new slot will be 'injected into' the gene class.

 * [default_curi_maps](default_curi_maps.md) - ordered list of prefixcommon biocontexts to be fetched to resolve id prefixes and inline prefix variables
 * [default_prefix](default_prefix.md) - default and base prefix -- used for ':' identifiers, @base and @vocab
 * [default_range](default_range.md) - default slot range to be used if range element is omitted from a slot definition
 * [defining_slots](defining_slots.md) - The combination of is a plus defining slots form a genus-differentia definition, or the set of necessary and sufficient conditions that can be transformed into an OWL equivalence axiom
 * [definition_uri](definition_uri.md) - the "native" URI of the element
 * [deprecated](deprecated.md) - Description of why and when this element will no longer be used
 * [deprecated element has exact replacement](deprecated_element_has_exact_replacement.md) - When an element is deprecated, it can be automatically replaced by this uri or curie

 * [extension➞tag](extension_tag.md) - a tag associated with an extension
 * [extension➞value](extension_value.md) - the actual annotation

 * [from_schema](from_schema.md) - id of the schema that defined the element
 * [generation_date](generation_date.md) - date and time that the schema was loaded/generated
 * [id](id.md) - The official schema URI
 * [id_prefixes](id_prefixes.md) - the identifier of this class or slot must begin with one of the URIs referenced by this prefix
 * [identifier](identifier.md) - True means that the key slot(s) uniquely identify the container. There can be at most one identifier or key per container
 * [ifabsent](ifabsent.md) - function that provides a default value for the slot.  Possible values for this slot are defined in biolink.utils.ifabsent_functions.default_library:
 * [imported_from](imported_from.md) - the imports entry that this element was derived from.  Empty means primary source
 * [imports](imports.md) - other schemas that are included in this schema

 * [inlined_as_list](inlined_as_list.md) - True means that an inlined slot is represented as a list of range instances.  False means that an inlined slot is represented as a dictionary, whose key is the slot key or identifier and whose value is the range instance.
 * [inverse](inverse.md) - indicates that any instance of d s r implies that there is also an instance of r s' d
 * [is_a](is_a.md) - specifies single-inheritance between classes or slots. While multiple inheritance is not allowed, mixins can be provided effectively providing the same thing. The semantics are the same when translated to formalisms that allow MI (e.g. RDFS/OWL). When translating to a SI framework (e.g. java classes, python classes) then is a is used. When translating a framework without polymorphism (e.g. json-schema, solr document schema) then is a and mixins are recursively unfolded
