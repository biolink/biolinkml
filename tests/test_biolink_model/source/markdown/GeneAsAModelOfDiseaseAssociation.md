## Parents

 *  is_a: [GeneToDiseaseAssociation](GeneToDiseaseAssociation.md)

## Uses Mixins

 *  mixin: [ModelToDiseaseMixin](ModelToDiseaseMixin.md) - This mixin is used for any association class for which the subject (source node) plays the role of a 'model', in that it recapitulates some features of the disease in a way that is useful for studying the disease outside a patient carrying the disease
 *  mixin: [EntityToDiseaseAssociation](EntityToDiseaseAssociation.md) - mixin class for any association whose object (target node) is a disease

    * inherited from: [Association](Association.md)
 * [object](object.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>

    * Description: connects an association to the agent (person, organization or group) that provided it
    * range: [Provider](Provider.md)
    * inherited from: [Association](Association.md)

### Inherited from entity to feature or disease qualifiers:

 * [severity qualifier](severity_qualifier.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: a qualifier used in a phenotypic association to state how severe the phenotype is in the subject
    * range: [SeverityValue](SeverityValue.md)
    * inherited from: [Association](Association.md)
 * [onset qualifier](onset_qualifier.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: a qualifier used in a phenotypic association to state when the phenotype appears is in the subject

    * inherited from: [Association](Association.md)

### Inherited from frequency qualifier mixin:

 * [frequency qualifier](frequency_qualifier.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: a qualifier used in a phenotypic association to state how frequent the phenotype is observed in the subject
    * range: [FrequencyValue](FrequencyValue.md)
    * inherited from: [Association](Association.md)
