## Attributes


### Inherited from named thing:

 * [id](id.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: A unique identifier for a thing. Must be either a CURIE shorthand for a URI or a complete URI
    * range: [IdentifierType](types/IdentifierType.md)
    * inherited from: [NamedThing](NamedThing.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [name](name.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: A human-readable name for a thing
    * range: [LabelType](types/LabelType.md)
    * inherited from: [NamedThing](NamedThing.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [category](category.md)  <sub>1..*</sub>
    * Description: Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class. In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag
    * range: [IriType](types/IriType.md)
    * inherited from: [NamedThing](NamedThing.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)

### Domain for slot:

 * [has input](has_input.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: holds between a process and a continuant, where the continuant is an input into the process
    * range: [NamedThing](NamedThing.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [has output](has_output.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: holds between a process and a continuant, where the continuant is an output of the process
    * range: [NamedThing](NamedThing.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [has participant](has_participant.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: holds between a process and a continuant, where the continuant is somehow involved in the process
    * range: [NamedThing](NamedThing.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [negatively regulates, process to process](negatively_regulates_process_to_process.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * range: [Occurrent](Occurrent.md)

    * range: [Occurrent](Occurrent.md)
 * [precedes](precedes.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: holds between two processes, where one completes before the other begins
    * range: [Occurrent](Occurrent.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [regulates, process to process](regulates_process_to_process.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * range: [Occurrent](Occurrent.md)
