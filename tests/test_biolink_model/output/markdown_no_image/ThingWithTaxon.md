## Mixin for

 * [AnatomicalEntity](AnatomicalEntity.md) (mixin)  - A subcellular location, cell type or gross anatomical part
 * [DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature](DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature.md) (mixin)  - Either one of a disease or an individual phenotypic feature. Some knowledge resources such as Monarch treat these as distinct, others such as MESH conflate.
 * [IndividualOrganism](IndividualOrganism.md) (mixin)  - An instance of an organism. For example, Richard Nixon, Charles Darwin, my pet cat. Example ID: ORCID:0000-0002-5355-2576
 * [LifeStage](LifeStage.md) (mixin)  - A stage of development or growth of an organism, including post-natal adult stages
 * [MolecularEntity](MolecularEntity.md) (mixin)  - A gene, gene product, small molecule or macromolecule (including protein complex)"
 * [PopulationOfIndividualOrganisms](PopulationOfIndividualOrganisms.md) (mixin)  - A collection of individuals from the same taxonomic class distinguished by one or more characteristics.  Characteristics can include, but are not limited to, shared geographic location, genetics, phenotypes [Alliance for Genome Resources]
