## Parents

 *  is_a: [MacromolecularMachine](MacromolecularMachine.md) - A union of gene, gene product, and macromolecular complex. These are the basic units of function in a cell. They either carry out individual biological activities, or they encode molecules which do this.

## Attributes


### Inherited from macromolecular machine:

 * [category](category.md)  <sub>1..*</sub>
    * Description: Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class.
 * In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag.
 * In an RDF database it should be a biolink model class URI.
This field is multi-valued. It should include values for ancestors of the biolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh would have category values `bl:Protein`, `bl:GeneProduct`, `bl:MolecularEntity`, ...
In an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type triples. This can be to the most specific biolink class, or potentially to a class more specific than something in biolink. For example, a sequence feature `f` may have a rdf:type assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than anything in biolink. Here we would have categories {bl:GenomicEntity, bl:MolecularEntity, bl:NamedThing}
    * range: [CategoryType](types/CategoryType.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [has biological sequence](has_biological_sequence.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: connects a genomic feature to its sequence
    * range: [BiologicalSequence](types/BiologicalSequence.md)
 * [id](id.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: A unique identifier for a thing. Must be either a CURIE shorthand for a URI or a complete URI
    * range: [String](types/String.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [macromolecular machineâžžname](macromolecular_machine_name.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: genes are typically designated by a short symbol and a full name. We map the symbol to the default display name and use an additional slot for full name
    * range: [SymbolType](types/SymbolType.md)
