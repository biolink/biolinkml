# Slot: publication_id


Different kinds of publication subtypes will have different preferred identifiers (curies when feasible). Precedence of identifiers for scientific articles is as follows: PMID if available; DOI if not; actual alternate CURIE otherwise. Enclosing publications (i.e. referenced by 'published in' node property) such as books and journals, should have industry-standard identifier such as from ISBN and ISSN.
