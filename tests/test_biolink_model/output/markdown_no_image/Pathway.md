## Attributes


### Inherited from biological process:

 * [category](category.md)  <sub>1..*</sub>
    * Description: Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class.
 * In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag.
 * In an RDF database it should be a biolink model class URI.
This field is multi-valued. It should include values for ancestors of the biolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh would have category values `bl:Protein`, `bl:GeneProduct`, `bl:MolecularEntity`, ...
In an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type triples. This can be to the most specific biolink class, or potentially to a class more specific than something in biolink. For example, a sequence feature `f` may have a rdf:type assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than anything in biolink. Here we would have categories {bl:GenomicEntity, bl:MolecularEntity, bl:NamedThing}
    * range: [CategoryType](types/CategoryType.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [enabled by](enabled_by.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: holds between a process and a physical entity, where the physical entity executes the process
    * range: [PhysicalEntity](PhysicalEntity.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [has input](has_input.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: holds between a process and a continuant, where the continuant is an input into the process
    * range: [NamedThing](NamedThing.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [has output](has_output.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: holds between a process and a continuant, where the continuant is an output of the process
    * range: [NamedThing](NamedThing.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [id](id.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: A unique identifier for a thing. Must be either a CURIE shorthand for a URI or a complete URI
    * range: [String](types/String.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [name](name.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: A human-readable name for a thing
    * range: [LabelType](types/LabelType.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
