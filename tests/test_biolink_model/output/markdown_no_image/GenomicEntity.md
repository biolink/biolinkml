# Type: genomic entity


an entity that can either be directly located on a genome (gene, transcript, exon, regulatory region) or is encoded in a genome (protein)

## Parents

 *  is_a: [MolecularEntity](MolecularEntity.md) - A gene, gene product, small molecule or macromolecule (including protein complex)

## Children

 * [CodingSequence](CodingSequence.md)
 * [Exon](Exon.md) - A region of the transcript sequence within a gene which is not removed from the primary RNA transcript by RNA splicing
 * [Genome](Genome.md) - A genome is the sum of genetic material within a cell or virion.
 * [Genotype](Genotype.md) - An information content entity that describes a genome by specifying the total variation in genomic sequence and/or gene expression, relative to some established background
 * [Haplotype](Haplotype.md) - A set of zero or more Alleles on a single instance of a Sequence[VMC]
 * [MacromolecularMachine](MacromolecularMachine.md) - A union of gene, gene product, and macromolecular complex. These are the basic units of function in a cell. They either carry out individual biological activities, or they encode molecules which do this.
 * [ReagentTargetedGene](ReagentTargetedGene.md) - A gene altered in its expression level in the context of some experiment as a result of being targeted by gene-knockdown reagent(s) such as a morpholino or RNAi
 * [SequenceVariant](SequenceVariant.md) - An allele that varies in its sequence from what is considered the reference allele at that locus.

## Attributes


### Own

 * [has biological sequence](has_biological_sequence.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: connects a genomic feature to its sequence
    * range: [BiologicalSequence](types/BiologicalSequence.md)

### Inherited from molecular entity:

 * [category](category.md)  <sub>1..*</sub>
    * Description: Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class.
 * In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag.
 * In an RDF database it should be a biolink model class URI.
This field is multi-valued. It should include values for ancestors of the biolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh would have category values `bl:Protein`, `bl:GeneProduct`, `bl:MolecularEntity`, ...
In an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type triples. This can be to the most specific biolink class, or potentially to a class more specific than something in biolink. For example, a sequence feature `f` may have a rdf:type assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than anything in biolink. Here we would have categories {bl:GenomicEntity, bl:MolecularEntity, bl:NamedThing}
    * range: [CategoryType](types/CategoryType.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [id](id.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: A unique identifier for a thing. Must be either a CURIE shorthand for a URI or a complete URI
    * range: [String](types/String.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [name](name.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: A human-readable name for a thing
    * range: [LabelType](types/LabelType.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
