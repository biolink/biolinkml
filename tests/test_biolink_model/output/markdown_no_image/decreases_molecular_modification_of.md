# Slot: decreases_molecular_modification_of


holds between two molecular entities where the action or effect of one leads to decreased molecular modification(s) of the other (e.g. via post-translational modifications of proteins such as the addition of phosphoryl group, or via redox reaction that adds or subtracts electrons)
