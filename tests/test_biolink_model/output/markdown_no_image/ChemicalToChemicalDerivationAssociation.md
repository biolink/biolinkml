# Type: chemical to chemical derivation association


A causal relationship between two chemical entities, where the subject represents the upstream entity and the object represents the downstream. For any such association there is an implicit reaction:
  IF
  R has-input C1 AND
  R has-output C2 AND
  R enabled-by P AND
  R type Reaction
  THEN
  C1 derives-into C2 <<change is catalyzed by P>>
