## Mixin for

 * [GeneToGeneCoexpressionAssociation](GeneToGeneCoexpressionAssociation.md) (mixin)  - Indicates that two genes are co-expressed, generally under the same conditions.
 * [VariantToGeneExpressionAssociation](VariantToGeneExpressionAssociation.md) (mixin)  - An association between a variant and expression of a gene (i.e. e-QTL)
