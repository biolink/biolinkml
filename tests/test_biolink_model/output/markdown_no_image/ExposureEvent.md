## Mixin for

 * [BehavioralExposure](BehavioralExposure.md) (mixin)  - A behavioral exposure is a factor relating to behavior impacting an individual.
 * [BioticExposure](BioticExposure.md) (mixin)  - An external biotic exposure is an intake of (sometimes pathological) biological organisms (including viruses).
 * [ChemicalExposure](ChemicalExposure.md) (mixin)  - A chemical exposure is an intake of a particular chemical substance, other than a drug.
 * [DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureExposure](DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureExposure.md) (mixin)  - A disease or phenotypic feature state, when viewed as an exposure, represents an precondition, leading to or influencing an outcome, e.g. HIV predisposing an individual to infections; a relative deficiency of skin pigmentation predisposing an individual to skin cancer.
 * [DrugExposure](DrugExposure.md) (mixin)  - A drug exposure is an intake of a particular drug.
 * [EnvironmentalExposure](EnvironmentalExposure.md) (mixin)  - A environmental exposure is a factor relating to abiotic processes in the environment including sunlight (UV-B), atmospheric (heat, cold, general pollution) and water-born contaminants.
 * [GenomicBackgroundExposure](GenomicBackgroundExposure.md) (mixin)  - A genomic background exposure is where an individual's specific genomic background of genes, sequence variants or other pre-existing genomic conditions constitute a kind of 'exposure' to the organism, leading to or influencing an outcome.
 * [GeographicExposure](GeographicExposure.md) (mixin)  - A geographic exposure is a factor relating to geographic proximity to some impactful entity.
 * [PathologicalAnatomicalExposure](PathologicalAnatomicalExposure.md) (mixin)  - An abnormal anatomical structure, when viewed as an exposure, representing an precondition, leading to or influencing an outcome, e.g. thrombosis leading to an ischemic disease outcome.
 * [PathologicalProcessExposure](PathologicalProcessExposure.md) (mixin)  - A pathological process, when viewed as an exposure, representing an precondition, leading to or influencing an outcome, e.g. autoimmunity leading to disease.
 * [SocioeconomicExposure](SocioeconomicExposure.md) (mixin)  - A socioeconomic exposure is a factor relating to social and financial status of an affected individual (e.g. poverty).
 * [Treatment](Treatment.md) (mixin)  - A treatment is targeted at a disease or phenotype and may involve multiple drug 'exposures', medical devices and/or procedures
